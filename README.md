# Attrition-Analysis

Hi!

My name is Allen Ansari and this is my repo for my Doing Data Science project: **Identify factors that lead to attrition.**

From Aug 2018  I completed a number of projects, including this, as part of my master degree program at *Southern Methodist University*.

In this Study I am looking to find any relationship between attrition and other variables like age, job level, monthly incom and etc that given by our client.

To find out more about this project, check out the attached presentation below!
